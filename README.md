The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- **fix:** a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in the codebase.

- **feat:** a commit of the type `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase.

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking change.

- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
